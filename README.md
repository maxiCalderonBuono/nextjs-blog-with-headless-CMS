# Next.Js Blog using a headless CMS

> **Warning**
> Version V1 is officially up and running. I'm building (trying) this in public. You can follow the progress on Twitter [@maxcal](https://twitter.com/mcalderonbuono).

For this project, I'm stepping into the exciting world of freelance development, building a blog using Next.js and a headless CMS for a friend, Andy, whom I met during a temporary work experience in Denmark.

## Idea

The blog will serve as a platform to express a unique perspective on the world, with a particular focus on politics and economy in Argentina. As a passionate writer, my friend wants to share his ideas and insights with a wider audience, and this blog will allow him to do just that. With Next.js and a headless CMS, we're creating a dynamic and responsive site that will showcase his writing in the best possible light. Whether you're interested in the latest developments in Argentine politics or want to learn more about the country's economy, this blog will be the perfect place to do it."
